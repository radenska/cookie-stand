        <h1>Why Salmon Cookies?</h1>
        <p>Three years ago, Pat lost a bet to her friend Felicia. She was instructed to make a cookie with fish in it and eat it in front of the gloating Felicia. She had some smoked salmon handy, so she ground it up as finely as she could and added it to her signature delicious chocolate chip cookie recipe. Her victorious friend watched the process like a hawk, assuring that she put the salmon in the cookies. </p>

        <p>Soon, the cookies were baked and ready to eat. Surprisingly, a delicous scent permeated the room when Pat opened the oven door. Felicia's face expressed her anticipation at seeing Pat's reaction to eating the salmon infused confection. Unable to put it off any longer, Pat picked up a cookie and gingerly (though this particular cookie did not contain ginger) took a bite.</p>

        <p>And smiled. The cookie was exceptionally delicious! Felicia's disappointment and confusion about why Pat's face was not contorted in the universal sign of "this tastes horrible" soon gave way to curiousity. She tried one of the cookies herself. Pat wasn't kidding - they were delicious! Since then, Pat has been perfecting her already tasty salmon cookie recipe, and making the world a more wonderfully flavorful place.</p>
